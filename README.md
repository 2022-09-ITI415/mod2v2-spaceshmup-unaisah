# 05-Space-SHMUP
# For this project I wanted to make an easy beginner version of Space Shmup for players like me who find it difficult to play with the original speed
# and pace. So I decided to make it very simple and enjoyable for users starting out to understand how the game works, as a very easy beginner. 
# For the Enemy1 c# I changed the wave frequency from 2 to 0
# For Enemy2 C# I changed the lifetime from 10 to 1
# For Enemy3 C# I changed lifetime from 5 to 1
# For Enemy 4 I changed the speed on Unity Inspector from 3 to 10
# On Unity I changed all of the enemy prefabs health lives to 1 so that they could die in a single shot
# Also whilst playing the game, I found myself wondering if I could be in two places at once so I added a Hero Bestfriend by duplicating the parent object on the # 
# hierarchy as well as the c# script and changed the position of it so that the player could see both heroes at the same time and defeat the enemies at a quicker pace.
# I would eventually like to add more controls to the second hero (bestfriend) so that they may move as though a separate entity or player, but currently they both move 
# together. I also changed the colors of the heros and the enemies to "Evil Kirbies"
